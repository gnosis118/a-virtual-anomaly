      <h2>The Hard Problem of AI Consciousness</h2>
      
      <p>
        Even if we could build AI systems with all the architectural components described above, a fundamental question remains: Would these 
        systems actually have subjective experiences—the "what it feels like" of emotions? This question parallels what philosopher David 
        Chalmers called "the hard problem of consciousness"—explaining how physical processes in a system give rise to subjective experience.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Some philosophers and scientists argue that consciousness emerges from certain types of information processing and could therefore 
        emerge in artificial systems implementing the right kind of processes. Theories like Integrated Information Theory propose that 
        consciousness arises from integrated information in a system, which could potentially apply to both biological and artificial systems.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Others maintain that consciousness is necessarily biological—that it requires the specific biochemical processes found in living 
        organisms and cannot be replicated in silicon. From this perspective, AI systems might simulate emotions convincingly but would never 
        truly experience them.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A third position holds that while artificial consciousness might be possible in principle, we may never be able to know with certainty 
        whether an AI system is conscious. This is the "other minds problem" applied to artificial intelligence—just as we cannot directly 
        access another person's subjective experience, we cannot directly access an AI's internal states to determine whether it has subjective 
        experiences.
