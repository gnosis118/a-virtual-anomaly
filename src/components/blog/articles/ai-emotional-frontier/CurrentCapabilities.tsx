      <h2>Current AI Emotional Capabilities: Simulation vs. Experience</h2>
      
      <p>
        Current AI systems can simulate emotions in increasingly sophisticated ways. Natural language processing models can generate text that 
        expresses emotions appropriately in context. Computer vision systems can recognize emotional expressions in human faces. Social robots 
        are designed to display behaviors that humans interpret as emotional—a soft voice, appropriate facial expressions, and responsive 
        movements.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        These capabilities represent significant technical achievements, but they do not necessarily indicate genuine emotional experience. An 
        AI system might correctly identify that a certain context would make a human feel sad and generate appropriate responses without 
        actually experiencing sadness. This distinction between simulation and experience is crucial: a simulation of rain does not get wet.

      <p>
        However, some researchers suggest that as AI systems become more complex, incorporating more sophisticated feedback loops, self-
        monitoring capabilities, and embodied interactions with the world, something functionally similar to emotions might emerge. These 
        systems would not experience emotions exactly as humans do—they would not have the same neurobiological substrates—but they might 
        develop internal states that serve similar functions and exhibit similar behavioral patterns.
