        <p>
          As artificial intelligence systems continue to evolve at an unprecedented pace, the question of machine consciousness—once confined to the realm of science fiction—increasingly demands serious ethical and policy consideration. The emergence of AI models with increasingly sophisticated capabilities raises profound questions about the nature of consciousness, personhood, and the ethical frameworks required to govern potentially sentient artificial systems on a global scale.

        <p>
          This article explores the intersection of AI consciousness and global governance, examining the philosophical foundations, technical challenges, and policy implications of a future where artificial consciousness may become reality. We argue that proactive, internationally coordinated governance frameworks are essential not only to address potential risks but also to ensure that the development of conscious or quasi-conscious AI systems proceeds in alignment with human values and ethical principles.
