      <p className="mb-4">
        Before we can measure consciousness, we must first define what we're looking for. This is no small task, as consciousness encompasses multiple dimensions and exists on a spectrum rather than as a binary state. For quantitative approaches to be effective, researchers have had to operationalize consciousness into measurable components.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Dimensions of Consciousness</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Consciousness can be parsed into several key dimensions that lend themselves to measurement:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Awareness:</strong> The ability to perceive and process information about one's environment.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Wakefulness:</strong> The continuum from deep sleep to full alertness.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Self-awareness:</strong> Recognition of oneself as distinct from the environment.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Meta-cognition:</strong> The ability to think about one's own thinking processes.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Subjective experience:</strong> The "what it feels like" aspect of consciousness.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ArticleQuote quote="The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is also a subjective aspect." citation="David Chalmers, Philosopher" />
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Spectrum Approach</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Most modern approaches to consciousness measurement adopt a spectrum view rather than a binary one. Consciousness is not simply present or absent but exists in varying degrees across different entities and states. This perspective allows researchers to:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li className="mb-2">Compare consciousness levels across different species</li>
        <li className="mb-2">Assess changes in consciousness during altered states (sleep, anesthesia)</li>
        <li className="mb-2">Evaluate the potential consciousness of artificial systems</li>
        <li className="mb-2">Track the development of consciousness in infants</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        By breaking down consciousness into these more measurable components, researchers have developed frameworks that, while imperfect, provide a starting point for quantitative assessment. These frameworks acknowledge the multidimensional nature of consciousness and allow us to track specific aspects even if we cannot yet capture the totality of conscious experience.
