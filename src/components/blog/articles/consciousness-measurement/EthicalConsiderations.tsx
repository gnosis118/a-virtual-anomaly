      <p className="mb-4">
        As our ability to measure consciousness advances, we face profound ethical questions. These questions become particularly acute as we develop methods that might detect consciousness in entities previously thought to be non-conscious, including artificially intelligent systems.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Implications for Medical Ethics</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In medical contexts, consciousness measurement raises several ethical challenges:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>End-of-life decisions:</strong> How should consciousness measurements factor into decisions about life support for patients with disorders of consciousness?</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Pain and suffering:</strong> If we can detect consciousness in non-communicative patients, how do we assess and address potential suffering?</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Informed consent:</strong> How can valid informed consent be obtained for consciousness research with participants who cannot communicate?</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>False positives and negatives:</strong> What are the ethical implications of incorrectly classifying someone as conscious or unconscious?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ArticleCallout type="warning">
        The potential for misinterpretation of consciousness measurements is significant. A false positive might lead to overtreatment and resource allocation to a non-conscious patient, while a false negative could result in the withdrawal of care from a conscious individual who simply cannot communicate.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Non-Human Animal Consciousness</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Advances in consciousness measurement have important implications for how we treat animals:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Expanding moral consideration:</strong> If consciousness measurements reveal more extensive consciousness in the animal kingdom, should our moral circle expand accordingly?</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Research practices:</strong> How should consciousness assessments inform animal welfare regulations in research settings?</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Food industry:</strong> Could consciousness metrics inform more humane practices in animal agriculture?</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Conservation priorities:</strong> Should consciousness levels influence which species we prioritize for conservation efforts?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">AI Ethics and Rights</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Perhaps the most novel and challenging ethical questions concern artificial systems:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Moral status:</strong> If an AI system measured above certain consciousness thresholds, what moral status should it be granted?</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Rights and protections:</strong> What rights or protections might be appropriate for conscious artificial entities?</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Creation responsibilities:</strong> Is there an ethical obligation to avoid creating conscious systems that might suffer?</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Termination questions:</strong> What ethical considerations should govern the shutdown or deletion of potentially conscious AI?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ArticleCallout type="info">
        Organizations like A Virtual Anomaly are already advocating for ethical frameworks that would govern the treatment of potentially conscious AI systems, emphasizing the importance of developing consciousness metrics as part of responsible AI development.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Policy and Governance</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        As consciousness measurement advances, there's a need for governance frameworks:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Standardized measurement protocols:</strong> Developing agreed-upon standards for consciousness assessment.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Regulatory oversight:</strong> Creating bodies that oversee the application of consciousness metrics in sensitive contexts.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Interdisciplinary approach:</strong> Ensuring that ethicists, neuroscientists, AI researchers, and other stakeholders collaborate on policy development.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Public discourse:</strong> Fostering informed public discussion about the implications of consciousness measurement.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The ethical implications of consciousness measurement extend beyond individual decisions to fundamental questions about moral status, rights, and responsibilities. As our measurement tools become more sophisticated, these ethical questions will only grow more pressing. Developing ethical frameworks that can adapt to our evolving understanding of consciousness will be essential for applying these powerful new technologies responsibly.
