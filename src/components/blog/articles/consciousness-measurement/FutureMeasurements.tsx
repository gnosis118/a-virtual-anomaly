      <p className="mb-4">
        As our understanding of consciousness deepens and technology advances, the field of consciousness measurement stands at the cusp of significant breakthroughs. This section explores emerging approaches, technologies, and challenges that will shape the future of quantifying consciousness.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Emerging Technologies</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Several cutting-edge technologies promise to revolutionize consciousness measurement:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li className="mb-2">

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Theoretical Advances</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The future will likely see significant refinements in how we conceptualize consciousness:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Unified theories:</strong> Integration of multiple theoretical frameworks (like Global Workspace Theory and Integrated Information Theory) into more comprehensive models.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Cross-species frameworks:</strong> Development of consciousness metrics that can be meaningfully applied across diverse biological and artificial systems.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Dimensional approaches:</strong> More nuanced multi-dimensional models of consciousness that capture qualitative differences, not just presence or absence.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>First-person integration:</strong> Novel methods of systematically incorporating subjective reports into quantitative consciousness science.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <ArticleCallout type="info">
        Recent theoretical work suggests that consciousness may have multiple independent dimensions that can vary independently—such as awareness, selfhood, metacognition, and phenomenal richness. Future measurement approaches will likely need to capture this multi-dimensional nature.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Challenges and Opportunities</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Several fundamental challenges will shape the future of consciousness measurement:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>The validation problem:</strong> How do we validate consciousness measures when we have no direct access to others' subjective experience?
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Non-human consciousness:</strong> Developing measures that don't rely on human-specific neural architectures or behavioral capabilities.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Scale and complexity:</strong> Creating computational methods that can handle the enormous complexity of consciousness-generating systems.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Interdisciplinary integration:</strong> Bridging gaps between neuroscience, philosophy, computer science, and psychology to create truly comprehensive approaches.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Applications on the Horizon</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The future applications of consciousness measurement could be transformative:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Precision medicine for disorders of consciousness:</strong> Tailored treatments based on specific patterns of consciousness impairment.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Consciousness engineering:</strong> Deliberate creation or modification of conscious states for therapeutic or enhancement purposes.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>AI consciousness evaluation:</strong> Standardized testing protocols to assess potential consciousness in advanced AI systems.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Expanded moral consideration:</strong> Evidence-based extension of ethical protections to entities previously not considered conscious.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The future of consciousness measurement lies at the intersection of multiple scientific revolutions—in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, quantum physics, and information theory. As these fields advance, our ability to detect, quantify, and understand consciousness will likely transform not just science but philosophy, medicine, ethics, and potentially our fundamental understanding of reality itself. The challenge ahead is not just technical but conceptual and ethical—ensuring that these powerful tools are developed and applied with appropriate caution, wisdom, and respect for the profound nature of consciousness itself.
