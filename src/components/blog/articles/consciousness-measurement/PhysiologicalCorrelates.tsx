      <p className="mb-4">
        Beyond neuroimaging, researchers have identified various physiological markers that correlate with conscious states. These measures acknowledge that consciousness isn't confined to the brain alone but manifests throughout the body's systems.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Autonomic Nervous System Indicators</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The autonomic nervous system shows distinct patterns associated with different states of consciousness:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Heart rate variability (HRV):</strong> Higher HRV often correlates with greater awareness and cognitive flexibility.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Pupil dilation:</strong> Changes in pupil size can indicate conscious perception of stimuli.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Skin conductance:</strong> Galvanic skin response patterns differ between conscious and unconscious processing of stimuli.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Respiratory patterns:</strong> Breathing rhythms change with alterations in conscious states.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Molecular and Cellular Markers</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        At a finer scale, researchers are identifying molecular signatures associated with consciousness:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Neurotransmitter levels:</strong> Concentrations of acetylcholine, dopamine, and other neurotransmitters vary with conscious states.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Metabolic markers:</strong> Patterns of glucose utilization differ between conscious and unconscious states.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Gene expression:</strong> Certain genes show different activity patterns during varying states of consciousness.</li>
      </ul>

        quote="Consciousness is not just in the head. The entire body is involved in the processing of information and the generation of conscious experience. We need an embodied approach to consciousness measurement."

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Integrated Physiological Measures</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The most promising approaches combine multiple physiological markers:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Multimodal integration:</strong> Combining EEG, autonomic measures, and behavioral responses provides more robust assessment than any single measure.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Machine learning approaches:</strong> AI algorithms can identify complex patterns across physiological measures that correlate with conscious states.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong>Longitudinal monitoring:</strong> Tracking changes in physiological markers over time can reveal fluctuations in consciousness levels.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Physiological correlates of consciousness offer complementary information to neuroimaging approaches. They are particularly valuable for:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li className="mb-2">Continuous monitoring of consciousness in clinical settings</li>
        <li className="mb-2">Understanding how consciousness manifests beyond the brain</li>
        <li className="mb-2">Developing less invasive and more accessible consciousness metrics</li>
        <li className="mb-2">Building a more comprehensive picture of consciousness as an embodied phenomenon</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        As research progresses, these physiological markers may be integrated into more comprehensive consciousness metrics that capture not just brain activity but the broader physiological context in which consciousness emerges.
