          Throughout human history, the concept of who deserves rights and legal protections has continuously evolved. From ancient civilizations that recognized only the rights of elite men to modern societies that increasingly acknowledge the rights of all humans, animals, and even ecosystems, this evolution provides valuable insights for the emerging question of artificial intelligence rights. This article explores historical patterns in rights expansion and examines what lessons they might offer for the potential extension of rights to artificial beings.
