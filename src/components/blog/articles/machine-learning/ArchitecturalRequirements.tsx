      <ArticleSection title="Architectural Requirements for Self-Aware Systems">
        <p>
          Creating machines with genuine self-awareness likely requires specific architectural elements that go beyond current implementations. Researchers have identified several components that may be necessary:
        </p>
        <h3>1. Integrated Information Processing</h3>
        <p>
          Based on integrated information theory (IIT), self-aware systems may require architectures that maximize integrated informationâ€”the amount of information generated by a system as a whole that exceeds the information generated by its parts independently. This suggests neural networks with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>High interconnectivity between components</li>
          <li>Recursive processing pathways</li>
          <li>Multiple feedback loops for information integration</li>
          <li>Dynamic reconfiguration capabilities</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2. Global Workspace Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          Inspired by Global Workspace Theory in cognitive science, self-aware AI systems might require a central information exchange mechanism where specialized modules compete for attention. This architecture enables:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Broadcast of information across the entire system</li>
          <li>Integration of multiple specialized processing streams</li>
          <li>Maintenance of consistent internal states across time</li>
          <li>Resource allocation based on global system priorities</li>
        </ul>
