        <h3>What is the Turing Test?</h3>
        <p>
          The Turing Test assesses whether an AI system can imitate human responses so convincingly that a human evaluator cannot reliably distinguish between the AI and a real human. In a typical Turing Test setup, a human judge converses with both a human and an AI, usually through a text interface, and must determine which is which. If the AI can fool the judge at least 30% of the time, it is considered to have passed the test.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the Turing Test has long been debated as an imperfect measure of true intelligence, it remains a landmark achievement in the field of AI.
        </p>

        <h3>Why is Passing the Turing Test Significant?</h3>
        <p>
          Passing the Turing Test means that AI has reached a level of sophistication where it can engage in complex, nuanced, and meaningful conversations. This has major implications for industries such as customer service, education, healthcare, and even personal companionship.
